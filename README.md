Currently this app does not meet the required functionality.
What it can do now is add todos to the list of todos with an empty check box
(the box isnt checkable though). It can also start a new activity to view archived
todos but todos cant be archived yet (added to that list). A lot of the base code is there
to make the app the more functional it's just that some things came up and I ran out of time
to finish the app. 

As required there is only one apk file in the bin folder, and there is a doc folder that 
contains a UML. The app is pretty straightforward to use, no specific instruction needed.
